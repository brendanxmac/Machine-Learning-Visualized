      <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
      <br><br><br>
      <h4><i>Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.</i></h4>

      <h4>It is software that 'learns' by collecting data and running an algorithm on that data to achieve a certain outcome.</h4><br>
      <h4>The development of computer programs that look at data and learn from it.</h4>
      <br>
      <h4>Three main types of machine learning exist: <strong>supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.</strong></h4>
      <br>
      <h4>Machine Learning has the ability to find correlations that humans might not be able to make on their own by processing and analyzing sets of data.</h4>

      <h2><strong>Types of Machine Learning</strong></h2><br><br><br>
      <img src="img/machine-learning-hierarchy.jpg" alt="Machine Learning Hierarchy"><br><br><br>
      <h3 id="supervised" name="supervised"><strong>1) Supervised Learning</strong></h3>
      <p>In supervised learning there are input varaibles (such as x,m,n) and output variables (think Y). An algorithm is used to try to understand the mapping function from the input to the output.If this is done successfully, new input variables (x,m,n..)
        can be entered into the algorithm, and have a high chance of predicting the output (Y)</p>
      <p><strong>Plain English: We feed the algorithm input (data) as well as desired output, and while processing the data the algorithm becomes 'smart' and able to make a connection between input and output.</strong> Think about a child flipping through
        a picture book with a teacher. The teacher knows the answer to what each animal is, and the child gives their best guess for what each animal is. If the child guesses incorrectly, the teacher can correct them and over time the child will hopefully
        learn
      </p>
      <h5><strong>Typical Supervised learning problems</strong></h5>
      <p><strong>Classification:</strong> the output variable is categorical e.g. monkey, apple, bird, healthy, unhealthy, etc..</p>
      <p><strong>Regression:</strong> the output variable is a value e.g. 13, $340.41, 65%, 0, 1, etc..</p>

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="unsupervised" name="unsupervised"><strong>2) Unsupervised Learning</strong></h3>
      <p>Similar to supervised learning there are input varaibles (such as x,m,n), however there are <strong>no linked output variables</strong> This type of learning is used to better understand the shape and distribution of the data in order to learn more
        about it. With unsupervised, there is no teacher and no correct answer. The point of this learning to to let the algorithm run in an attempt to discover and display something interesting (usually valuable) about the data</p>
      <p><strong>Plain English: We feed the algorithm input (data) and hope it spits back something interesting that we might not have found on our own</strong></p>
      <h5><strong>Typical Unsupervised learning problems</strong></h5>
      <p><strong>Clustering:</strong> Find groups (clusters) within the data. That is, data that are more closely link to eachother than all other data points</p>
      <p><strong>Association:</strong> Find connecitons within the data. e.g. people who bought a large popcorn had a x% chance of buying soda as well. </p>
      <br>
