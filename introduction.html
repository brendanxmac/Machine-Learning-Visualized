    <h2><strong>What is Machine Learning?</strong></h2>
    <br><br><br>
    <h4><strong>Machine learning is software written by a programmer, just like any other code.</strong></h4><br>
    <h5>It is software that 'learns': <u>by collecting data and running an algorithm on that data.</u>.</h5>
    <ul>
      <h6><li>Machine learning involves the development of computer programs that look at data and learn from it.</li></h6>
      <h6><li>Four different types of machine learning exist: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning.</li></h6>
      <h6><li>Machine Learning has the ability to make correlations that humans might not be able to make on their own, as well as process and analyze huge sets of data.</li></h6>
    </ul>
    <p><i>Note: In machine learning, the input is data (and sometimes expected output), and the actual output is <strong>a program</strong> that learned something about the data (and sometimes expected output) that can then be fed more data to make better predictions
    when fed more input</i></p>

    <hr><br>

    <h2><strong>Types of Machine Learning</strong></h2><br><br><br>

    <h3 id="supervised" name="supervised"><strong>Supervised Learning</strong></h3>
    <p>In supervised learning there are input varaibles (such as x,m,n) and output variables (think Y). An algorithm is used to try to understand the mapping function from the input to the output.If this is done successfully, new input variables (x,m,n..)
      can be entered into the algorithm, and have a high chance of predicting the output (Y)</p>
    <p><strong>Plain English: We feed the algorithm input (data) as well as desired output, and while processing the data the algorithm becomes 'smart' and able to make a connection between input and output.</strong> Think about a child flipping through
      a picture book with a teacher. The teacher knows the answer to what each animal is, and the child gives their best guess for what each animal is. If the child guesses incorrectly, the teacher can correct them and over time the child will hopefully
      learn
    </p>
    <h5><strong>Typical Supervised learning problems</strong></h5>
    <p><strong>Classification:</strong> the output variable is categorical e.g. monkey, apple, bird, healthy, unhealthy, etc..</p>
    <p><strong>Regression:</strong> the output variable is a value e.g. 13, $340.41, 65%, 0, 1, etc..</p>

    <br><br>

    <h3 id="unsupervised" name="unsupervised"><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong></h3>
    <p>Similar to supervised learning there are input varaibles (such as x,m,n), however there are <strong>no linked output variables</strong> This type of learning is used to better understand the shape and distribution of the data in order to learn more
      about it. With unsupervised, there is no teacher and no correct answer. The point of this learning to to let the algorithm run in an attempt to discover and display something interesting (usually valuable) about the data</p>
    <p><strong>Plain English: We feed the algorithm input (data) and hope it spits back something interesting that we might not have found on our own</strong></p>
    <h5><strong>Typical Unsupervised learning problems</strong></h5>
    <p><strong>Clustering:</strong> Find groups (clusters) within the data. That is, data that are more closely link to eachother than all other data points</p>
    <p><strong>Association:</strong> Find connecitons within the data. e.g. people who bought a large popcorn had a x% chance of buying soda as well. </p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="reinforcement" name="reinforcement"><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong></h3>
