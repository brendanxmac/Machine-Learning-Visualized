# Machine-Learning-Visualized
Visualizes the execution of machine learning algorithms step by step

This was a project that attempts to teach beginners to machine learning how to conceptually and intuitively understand machine learning concepts and algorithms.

This is a purely HTML, CSS, Javascript website that utilizes anime.js for animations. 

There is a 101 style introduction to machine learning after clicking through the landing page.
Following this the user can navigate through the different algorithms.

There are 5 algorithms covered:

1. KMeans
2. K Nearest Neighbors
3. Linear Regression
4. Logistic Regression
5. Naive Bayes

Each algorithm page includes:

- Step-by-step Animation of the algorithm executing
- An abstract explanation of the algorithm for intuitive 
  understanding at a higher level
- The algorithm in detail
- "In A Nutshell" section covering usage and features
- Links for further learning
